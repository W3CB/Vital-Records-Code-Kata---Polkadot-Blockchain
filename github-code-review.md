## Substrate-Specific Best Practices

### Storage Design

- [ ] **Storage Keys are Optimized**
  - [ ] Use `Blake2_128Concat` for storage that needs secure hashing and iteration capabilities
  - [ ] Use `Twox64Concat` only when keys are trusted and not user-generated
  - [ ] Use `Identity` only for small sequential keys (like u8, u16) when performance is critical

- [ ] **Appropriate Storage Types**
  - [ ] Storage maps use appropriate key and value types with minimal size
  - [ ] Complex types implement proper encoding/decoding traits
  - [ ] Storage iterables are used only when iteration is necessary
  - [ ] Double maps are used for "two-key" lookups instead of nested maps

- [ ] **Bounded Collections**
  - [ ] Use `BoundedVec` instead of `Vec` for user-controlled inputs
  - [ ] Set reasonable maximum sizes based on usage requirements
  - [ ] Include proper error handling for bound check failures

- [ ] **Storage Migrations**
  - [ ] Include version tracking for storage schema
  - [ ] Implement migration path for storage structure changes
  - [ ] Test migrations with real data scenarios

### Dispatachable Functions

- [ ] **Weight Calculations**
  - [ ] Every dispatchable function has appropriate weight calculation
  - [ ] Weights account for worst-case execution scenarios
  - [ ] Weights are benchmarked and not just estimated
  - [ ] Variable input weights (e.g., for vectors) are properly calculated

- [ ] **Origin Checks**
  - [ ] Each function has proper origin checks as early as possible
  - [ ] Use `ensure_signed` for user transactions
  - [ ] Use `ensure_root` for privileged operations
  - [ ] Use custom origins for specialized access control

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - [ ] Custom errors are defined for all failure conditions
  - [ ] Error types are descriptive and help with debugging
  - [ ] Functions return appropriate errors instead of panicking
  - [ ] Error paths are thoroughly tested

- [ ] **Input Validation**
  - [ ] All user inputs are validated before use
  - [ ] Input validation occurs before any state changes
  - [ ] Numeric inputs check for underflow/overflow
  - [ ] String inputs have appropriate length constraints

### Events and Hooks

- [ ] **Comprehensive Events**
  - [ ] Events are emitted for all significant state changes
  - [ ] Events include relevant information for tracking
  - [ ] Events are properly documented with clear meaning
  - [ ] Events follow consistent naming conventions

- [ ] **Proper Hook Implementation**
  - [ ] `on_initialize` and `on_finalize` are used appropriately
  - [ ] Hooks have reasonable weight limits to prevent block issues
  - [ ] Genesis configuration initializes all required state

### Security Considerations

- [ ] **Privilege Management**
  - [ ] Registrar privileges can't be easily abused
  - [ ] Privilege escalation paths are protected
  - [ ] Root-only functions are minimized and well-guarded

- [ ] **Prevention of Common Attacks**
  - [ ] No reentrancy vulnerabilities
  - [ ] No transaction ordering vulnerabilities (front-running)
  - [ ] No storage poisoning vulnerabilities
  - [ ] No integer overflow/underflow issues

  - [ ] Person-to-certificate mapping is bi-directional

### Death Certificate Implementation

- [ ] **Birth Certificate Verification**
  - [ ] Death certificates properly validate against birth certificates
  - [ ] Multiple death certificates for same person are prevented
  - [ ] Date validations ensure death date is after birth date
  - [ ] Cross-record impacts are implemented (e.g., invalidating licenses)

### Driver's License Implementation

- [ ] **Age Verification**
  - [ ] Driver's license issuance properly validates age requirements
  - [ ] License classes have appropriate restrictions
  - [ ] License expiration is properly calculated and tracked

  - [ ] Deceased voters are properly handled

## Performance and Optimization

- [ ] **Storage Efficiency**
  - [ ] Minimize stored data size (use hashes instead of full records when possible)
  - [ ] Use appropriate data structures for lookup patterns
  - [ ] Avoid unnecessary cloning of data
  - [ ] Use storage maps instead of vecs for O(1) lookups

- [ ] **Operation Batching**
  - [ ] Combine multiple storage reads/writes when possible
  - [ ] Avoid repeated calculations of the same values
  - [ ] Use transactional storage operations when appropriate

- [ ] **Computational Efficiency**
  - [ ] Minimize on-chain computation complexity
  - [ ] Use logarithmic rather than linear algorithms where possible
  - [ ] Offload heavy computation to off-chain workers when appropriate

## Privacy Features

- [ ] **Data Minimization**
  - [ ] Only essential information is stored on-chain
  - [ ] Sensitive data is hashed or encrypted when stored
  - [ ] Public functions return minimal necessary information

- [ ] **Selective Disclosure**

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Substrate-Specific Anti-Patterns

- [ ] **Unbounded Collection Storage**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Using `Vec<T>` for user-supplied inputs without bounds
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Use `BoundedVec<T, S>` with appropriate size limits

- [ ] **Inadequate Origin Checking**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Performing actions before checking origin
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Always perform origin checks at the start of dispatchable functions

- [ ] **Direct Storage Access in Loops**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Reading from storage repeatedly in a loop
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Read into a local variable once, then operate on the local copy

- [ ] **Silent Failures**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Ignoring error conditions or using `unwrap()`/`expect()`
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Proper error handling with custom error types

- [ ] **Inefficient Storage Keys**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Using complex or unnecessary data for storage keys
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Use minimal, fixed-size keys when possible

### Vital Records Anti-Patterns

- [ ] **Missing Cross-Record Validation**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Creating dependent records without validating prerequisites
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Implement proper validation against dependent records

- [ ] **Insecure Status Transitions**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Allowing invalid state transitions (e.g., revoked to valid)
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Enforce strictly defined state machines for record status

- [ ] **Unrestricted Privileged Operations**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: All registrars have access to all operations
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Implement fine-grained role-based access control

- [ ] **Insufficient Privacy Controls**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: All record data publicly accessible without restrictions
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Implement proper privacy mechanisms with user consent tracking

- [ ] **Missing Audit Trails**
  - ❌ ANTI-PATTERN: Record modifications without history tracking
  - ✅ SOLUTION: Maintain history of all significant record changes
