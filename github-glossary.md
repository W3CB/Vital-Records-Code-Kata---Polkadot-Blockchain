## Blockchain and Polkadot Terms

### A

**Account**: A unique identifier on the blockchain that can send transactions and hold assets. In Substrate, accounts are represented by a cryptographic key pair and have an associated address.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**: A set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software, used to communicate between different software components. For Polkadot, this often refers to the Polkadot.js API used to interact with the blockchain.

### B

**Block**: A group of transactions bundled together and added to the blockchain. Each block contains a reference to the previous block, forming a chain.

**Blockchain**: A distributed, immutable digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in a way that ensures that records cannot be altered retroactively.

**Blake2**: A cryptographic hash function used in Substrate/Polkadot for creating unique identifiers and secure hashing.

### C

**Chain Specification**: A file that defines the properties of a blockchain, including the consensus mechanism, initial state, and runtime configuration.

**Consensus**: The mechanism by which a network of nodes reaches agreement on the state of a blockchain. Polkadot uses GRANDPA for finality and BABE for block production.

**Cross-chain**: Refers to the ability to transfer data or assets between different blockchains. Polkadot is designed specifically to enable cross-chain communication.

### D

**Decentralized**: A system where control and decision-making are distributed rather than being in the hands of a single entity.

**Dispatchable Function**: In Substrate, these are functions that can be called from outside the runtime (similar to "public methods" in traditional programming).

### E

**Event**: In Substrate, events are emitted by pallets to notify users of important changes or actions in the system. They serve as a record of significant occurrences.

**Extrinsic**: Any data that comes from outside the blockchain and is included in a block. Transactions are the most common type of extrinsic.

### F

**Finality**: The property of a blockchain that guarantees transactions cannot be reverted once confirmed. Polkadot uses the GRANDPA finality gadget.

### H

**Hash**: A function that converts an input of arbitrary length into a fixed-size string of bytes. Used in blockchains for creating unique identifiers and data verification.

### I

**Immutability**: The property that ensures data, once written to the blockchain, cannot be changed or tampered with.

### L

**Ledger**: A record-keeping system where transactions are recorded. Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger.

### N

**Node**: A computer that participates in a blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions.

### O

**Origin**: In Substrate, the source of a dispatchable call, typically a user's account (signed) or a more privileged source like a governance mechanism (root).

### P

**Pallet**: In Substrate, a module that encapsulates specific functionality for a blockchain. Pallets are the building blocks of a Substrate runtime.

**Parachain**: A blockchain that runs parallel to the Polkadot Relay Chain and is connected to it, benefiting from its security and interoperability features.

**Polkadot**: A multi-chain blockchain platform designed to enable different blockchains to interoperate and share information.

**Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral.

### R

**Relay Chain**: The central chain of the Polkadot network that provides security to the connected parachains and handles their shared security, consensus, and cross-chain interoperability.

**Runtime**: The state transition function of a blockchain that defines how the blockchain's state changes in response to transactions.

### S

**Smart Contract**: Self-executing code that automatically implements the terms of an agreement when predetermined conditions are met.

**Storage**: In Substrate, the persistent data that is maintained by the blockchain. Different storage types include StorageValue, StorageMap, and StorageDoubleMap.

**Substrate**: A modular framework for building blockchains, which serves as the foundation for Polkadot and its parachains.

### T

**Transaction**: A record of an action signed by an account that modifies the state of a blockchain.

### V

**Validator**: A node that participates in the consensus of a Proof of Stake blockchain by staking tokens and validating transactions and blocks.

**Weight**: In Substrate, a measure of the execution time and storage impact of an extrinsic, used to determine transaction fees.

## Government and Vital Records Terms
