# Vital Records Management on Polkadot

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)
![Status: In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Development-yellow)

A comprehensive implementation of government vital records (birth certificates, marriage licenses, death certificates, driver's licenses, and voter registration) on a Polkadot blockchain.

## Overview

This project provides a complete solution for managing vital records on a blockchain, offering advantages in security, transparency, and privacy over traditional systems.

- **Security**: Immutable records with cryptographic verification
- **Transparency**: Clearly tracked record modifications with registrar accountability
- **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs and selective disclosure mechanisms
- **Resiliency**: Distributed architecture resistant to data loss or tampering
- **Interoperability**: Cross-chain compatibility through Polkadot's parachain architecture

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- **Substrate Pallet**: Core blockchain logic for vital records management
- **Frontend Application**: React-based UI for citizens and government officials
- **API Layer**: Polkadot.js integration for blockchain communication

## Key Features

- üîí **Marriage License Management**: Request, approve, and track marriage licenses
- üìÑ **Birth Certificate Issuance**: Register births with parental information
- üìã **Death Certificate Processing**: Record deaths with proper verification
- ü™™ **Driver's License System**: Issue, renew, and revoke licenses with classes and endorsements
- üó≥Ô∏è **Voter Registration**: Register voters with district management and eligibility verification
- üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy Protections**: Zero-knowledge proofs for age verification without revealing birthdate
- üö® **Emergency Simulations**: Test system under disaster scenarios
